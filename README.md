# Luhn algorithm with From trait
This library provides a struct which implements the Luhn algorithm, and which can be created from any `ToString` type using the `From` trait. It is my solution to the Exercism.org "Luhn From" exercise.
# Usage
See tests for usage examples, and use `cargo test` to run tests.
# Concepts reviewed
- `From` trait
- `ToString` trait
